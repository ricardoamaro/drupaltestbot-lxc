# The text in this file doesn't matter. The key is to *change* it whenever
# you want apt-get upgrade to run on the testbot.
# For example, add a new timestamp to the end when you want it to run.
# Obvious times to do this are when updating the drupaltestbot package
# or when forcing a new php version, etc.
